1. Install necessary libraries: You will need to install libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and SimpleITK.

2. Create a 3D array: Create a 3D array of the size of the desired image. This array will represent the phantom.

3. Define tissue types: Define different tissue types such as gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by assigning different values to each voxel in the 3D array.

4. Add noise: Add noise to the phantom image to make it more realistic.

5. Convert to an image format: Convert the 3D array into an image format such as DICOM or NIfTI using SimpleITK.

6. Visualize the image: Use Matplotlib to visualize the created phantom image.


for T1:
-black ==> Fluid (eg.urine or CSF)
-gray  ==> Muscle - brain gray matter
-white ==> Fats - brain white matter

for T2:
-black ==> brain white matter
-gray  ==> Muscle - brain gray matter
-white ==> Fluid (eg.urine or CSF) - Fats 

for PD:
-black ==> fibrocartilage
-gray  ==> Muscle - hyaline cartilage
-white ==> Fluid (eg.urine or CSF) - Fats 

Git tool steps:

for the first time :
1- create new folder
2- open visual code command or terminal
3- git init
4- git add .
5- git remote add origin https://github.com/Abanoob-Meseha/MRI_Simulator.git
6- git pull -a origin master

after having any update in the code :
1- git add .
2- git commit -m"ah haga"
3- git push -u origin master

save all your new feature in a file with your name first .
